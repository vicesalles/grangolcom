    "introStadium": "The GGx stadium is easy and quick to assemble. It can be set up on any minimally smooth surface, from any sufficiently large table to the floor. If the pieces slide, any place is good for a match. Easy and quick to disassemble, in the blink of an eye, the match is underway, played, and packed up before you need to set the table or go to bed. The playing field measures 90x120 cm but, when packed, it fits into a small box.",
    "partsStadium": "The standard GGx stadium consists of 4 end fences, 10 side fences, 2 goals, 4 goal connectors, 12 fasteners, and 4 corner fasteners. In general, these are very sturdy pieces. The fasteners might be the most likely to break, so it's always worth having a few spares. Among the side fences, there are some special ones: they are accessory bars with two small attachment points where you can mount a scoreboard or other accessories."
