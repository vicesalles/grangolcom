    "p1":"Statistics are like a tool that helps us understand things better through numbers. In football, statistics are super important because they allow us to know what happens in a match and why some teams win and others lose. For example, when we see how many goals a player has scored, how many shots on target they’ve made, or how many passes they’ve completed, we’re looking at statistics.",
    "p2":"These numbers help coaches improve tactics, figure out what players need to work on, and which strategies work best. They also allow us to compare players from all over the world and discover who are the best in different aspects of the game. So, when you see statistics in football, remember they are like clues that help us better understand everything that happens on the field!"
