Gran Gol is a PC football game. It’s not a simulator, it’s a card game. As of today, I can say with conviction and commitment that the game is moving forward. This summer I completed the third sprint, and my commitment to the project has skyrocketed. What I found when I started the sprint I liked; what I leave behind now I’m passionate about. I’m very satisfied with the gameplay mechanics: easy to learn, hard to master. As of today, it’s already possible to play a full match in a controlled environment. Now it’s time to play with people and listen to them.
